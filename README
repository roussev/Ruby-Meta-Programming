Title: Writing Beautiful APIs and DSLs in Ruby
Subtitle: Ruby Metaprogramming & Parallel RPC for Restful APIs

Content: Ruby code from my talk on Ruby metaprogramming I gave at LinkedIn in July 2011

Ruby object model
- modules
- singleton class
- class include and object extend
- hook methods

Blocks, procs, and lambdas
- package code to execute later
- carry variables across method and class scopes
-currying

Monkey patching
- examples from Rails

Metaprogramming - code that manipulates itself at runtime
- introspection 
- create methods at runtime
- intercept method call and route calls
- accept calls to methods that do not exist
- class_eval and instance_eval

Techniques
- class macros, examples from Rails
- calling methods dynamically
- creating methods dynamically
- deleting all methods to create Blank Slates
- ghost methods
- method_missing(), OpenStruct and dynamic proxies
- contant_missing and respond_to
- around alias

Testing and benchmarking - performance anxiety no more

Writing beautiful DSLs

Putting metaprogramming to work

Restful services and API design
- non-blocking I/O with multi-curl C binding
- parallel RPC, serialization, and hydration for restful services
