p "Binding Objects"

p "A binding is a scope packaged as an object. We can create a binding to capture the"
p "local scope and carry it around. Later, we can execute code in that scope"
p  "using with eval(), instance_eval(), or class_eval()."

p "We can view Binding objects as a 'purer' form of closures than blocks, because these objects"
p "contain a scope but donâ€™t contain code."
